# Welcome to WHS Aerospace!

This is the central repository for the WHS Aerospace Club Website! 

## For Site Contributors

For those who want to contribute to the site, use [template.html](https://github.com/whsaerospace/whsaerospace.github.io/tree/master/template.html) as a starting point, as it contains the header, nav, and footer common to all pages. There is also a stylesheet\- [style.css](https://github.com/whsaerospace/whsaerospace.github.io/tree/master/style.css)\- which is used by this template. Currently, there are two section types for page content: The id "main-section" and the class "section". The main section id is used for content near the top of the page which is intended to draw in people's attention. The section class is just used for the rest of the page content.
