## For Site Contributors

For those who want to contribute to the site, use [template.html](https://github.com/whsaerospace/whsaerospace.github.io/tree/master/template.html) as a starting point, as it contains the header, nav, and footer common to all pages. There is also a stylesheet\- [style.css](https://github.com/whsaerospace/whsaerospace.github.io/tree/master/style.css)\- which is used by this template. Currently, there are three section types: The id "main-section" and the classes "light-section" and "dark-section". The main section id denotes the most important section, whereas the light and dark sections create a contrast that allows for thematic breaks. I recommend alternating between the two after a single main section \(if a given page warrants a main section\).
